Description: FreezerCheck is a quality assurance and control dashboard for 
  conducting aliquot position audits within the NIST Biorepository. It 
  depends heavily on the commercial product Freezerworks, but could be
  modified to tap into any connected data source where aliquot location
  information is found. Audits are curated to focus on specific freezers
  to allow for large repositories to achieve adequate position accuracy 
  assessments with as little effort as is feasible. Past audits are recorded
  and a record of discrepancies (and their resolutions) is maintained. This
  should be considered for demonstration purposes only unless your repository
  also uses Freezerworks, in which case only a moderate modification will
  be necessary.
